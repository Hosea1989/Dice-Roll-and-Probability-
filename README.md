Name: ðŸŽ² Dice Roll

    1. Make a dice and rolls it 10000 times. Each time you count how many times each face [1-6] appears and check if
    the random number actually works. Please make your program to roll once and then make it roll 10 times for
    easier debugging. And then you can increase the number of roll to be 10000. You can use this
    NUMBER_OF_ROLL as a constant and changes when needed. Or you can make it a user input. However, you
    should not use this number of roll hard-coded!!!
    
    2. Comment your code carefully assuming you are teaching your friend to learn from your comments.
